# BeBold Extension

BeBold is a browser extension designed to enhance reading comprehension for individuals with ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder). It achieves this by bolding the first half of each word on a webpage, providing a unique reading style that helps users to concentrate better on the text.

### What I Learned

Throughout the process of creating the BeBold extension, I learned the following:

- How to create a browser extension from scratch.
- The importance of manifest files in defining the extension's structure and behavior.
- How to create and apply content scripts to modify web content.
- The process of traversing and manipulating the DOM (Document Object Model).
- How to consider the unique cognitive needs of individuals with ADHD and develop a solution tailored to their requirements.

### How to Fork and Use the Extension Locally

If you would like to use the BeBold extension locally on your computer or contribute to the project, follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository: Click the "Fork" button at the top-right corner of the original repository to create a copy of the project under your own GitHub account.

2. Clone the forked repository: Clone the repository to your local machine by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

Copy code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cdukedev/BeBold.git
```

3. Load the extension in your browser:

--Google Chrome:

- Compress the BeBold directory into a .zip file.
- Open Chrome and navigate to chrome://extensions/.
- Enable "Developer mode" by toggling the switch in the top-right corner.
- Click the "Load unpacked" button and select the BeBold directory from your local machine.

The BeBold extension should now be installed and ready for use in your browser. Test it out by visiting any webpage and observing the bolded text.
